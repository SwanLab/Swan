Run the code Problem_time_poisson.m

Poisson equation with specified forcing.
Bilinear rectangular element

Problem_poisson.m solves the FEM with \\theta = 1 (meaning explicit scheme) and FDM with 5-point
stencil using the variable **sol_method** **theta=0.5** is Crank Nikolson

Using the variable solver, choose the solver between MATLAB default solver, conjugate gradient method, gauss seidel and multi-grid method (with Gauss seidel iterations).

The post-processing plot has the name dummy.pdf.

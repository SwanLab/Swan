# Classic Algebraic Multigrid Method (AMG) Demo

Na√Øve implementation of the Classic Algebraic Multigrid Method (AMG). The major procedure of the multigrid solver and the parameters in the solver (like the number of pre- and post-smoother) is almost the same as [my previous GMG repo](https://github.com/EnigmaHuang/Poisson_FDM_Multigrid). Source codes are clean and should be easy to read. Generating coarse grid problem may be a little slow :)

**Notice: The ''Second pass'' in generating coarse grid in Classic AMG is not included in my code.** 

Here is a small comparison of Geometric Multigrid (GMG) and Algebraic Multigrid (AMG):

Here is another test case: solving the linear system generated by FEM using uniform triangular element (using MATLAB code in [this repo](https://github.com/EnigmaHuang/Poisson2D_FEM) to generate data):

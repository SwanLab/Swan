Swan can be used to **design materials** in many diﬀerent ways, including:

- Usage of **inverse homogenization** constraints
- An optimal topology for a microstructure is found given a **pre-established relations** between the terms of the constitutive tensor
- Given a **user-deﬁned constitutive tensor**, an optimal topology for a microstructure is found

This is one of the main lines of research of Swan's developers.

These designs are also easily exportable, making Swan the ideal toolbox to design your pieces and 3D-print them directly.

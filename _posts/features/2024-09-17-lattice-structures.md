Swan can **dehomogenize optimal solutions** in order to obtain feasible lattice structures:

- Up to millions of variables can be used
- Very fast optimization
- Usage of implicit functions
- Manufacturability ensured through constraints

These designs are also easily exportable, making Swan the ideal toolbox to design your pieces and 3D-print them directly.

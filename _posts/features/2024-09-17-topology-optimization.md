Of course, Swan is capable of solving **topology optimization** problems like other commercial software. Some additional features that make it stand out are:

- Usage of **varied constraints** that allow tailor-made solutions
- Possibility of using **different optimizers** for the same problem

These designs are also easily exportable, making Swan the ideal toolbox to design your pieces and 3D-print them directly.

   The gypsilab project is an open-source MATLAB toolbox for fast numerical 
computation with finite element and boundary element methods. Accessible 
with a high-level programming language, it gives a useful framework for 
fast prototyping. Initially designed for numerical acoustics, many physics 
problems can also be addressed.

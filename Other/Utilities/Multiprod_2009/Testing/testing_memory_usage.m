function testing_memory_usage
% TESTING_MEMORY_USAGE  Testing memory allocation by commands and engines.
%     This script requires MATLAB R2007a or higher (because it uses
%     BSXFUN), and at least 360 MB of free RAM.
%     Please open Task Manager (CTRL+ALT+DEL - "Processes" tag), to check
%     the memory used by the MATLAB process. Add a column showing "Peak
%     memory usage" (use menu "View" > "Select columns"). 
%     Before running this script, please close MATLAB to delete previous
%     value in the "Peak memory usage" column, then open it again.
